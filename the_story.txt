Once upon a time


The mean professor, who is a Beaman Monster, made a class redo a homework exercise
The hero of this story is nowhere to be found
So the class organized a massive search party to find the hero to slay this Beaman Monster posing as the professor
Then Jake redid his assignment while watching Ip Man.
It's a cool movie if you're in the mood.
Then more and more students, who were really Andean Wolves, began fixing their assignments.
Everyone joined in and watched the movie.

Just then a group of ninjas burst in, all of whom were masters of shaolin shadowboxing and the Wu-Tang sword style.
"We're here to bring the ruckus!" they shouted.
'Bring us the one who messed up this assignment' the ninjas demanded 'we shall make them pay'
 So the class all turned in the guy who had added broken code to the last exercise and the ninjas took him away.

But still the hero of the story was nowhere to be found.
The ninjas walked away. All the students finished Ip Man and started watching Ong Bak 2

The end.
